## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (v6 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/priceprophet.git
   cd priceprophet

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
    npm install
3. Running the Application
    Development
    To run the application in development mode with automatic restarts on file changes, use:
   ```bash
    npm run dev
   ```
    This command uses nodemon to watch for changes in the src directory and restart the server automatically.

4. Production
To build and run the application in production mode, use:
   ```bash
    npm run build
    npm run start:prod
   ```
   This will compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript and then start the application using Node.js.
